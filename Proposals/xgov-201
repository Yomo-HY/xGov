## Abstract
H&Y NFT's Astro Explorer is web3's go-to arcade on the Algorand blockchain and Ripple blockchain. Nearing 400,000 explorations and 300,000 on-chain transactions, our arcade provides users with fun gaming, prizes, and more than enough reasons to continue to enjoy their time in the Algorand ecosystem.
Currently we have 4 games with a 5th game en-route. All games and development have been funded by the project itself.

## Team
Yomo - Eric Moses, an Algorand community member since June of 2021 and a project lead since November of 2021.
Agash - Lead Developer, CTO of Rand Gallery and a trusted and skilled fullstack developer.

## Experience with Algorand
We've built out one of the most used utility across the Algorand space. Outside of what we've done with the arcade, we've built partnerships with other projects to increase engagement
and stickiness to the ecosystem. Agash, our lead developer, has built countless dApps for the ecosystem. Examples include his work with Rand Gallery, Crazy Goose Flock, and of course, H&Y NFTs.

## Present Proposal
This is a retroactive proposal to help us keep building and providing weekly prizes for our holders and the entire ecosystem dependent on collaborative events. 

To enhance clarity and accountability, we're asking proposers to detail the maintenance period, availability, and sustainability plans for their projects. This includes information on potential costs and the duration for which services will be offered at no or reduced cost
Costs include Algorand NFTs, development work from Agash, and time spent by Yomo.

### Deliverable
We will deliver a 5th game for the ecosystem and continue to provide prizes to those who earn through engagement and gaming. We won't stop there. The goal is to get to 10 games
in the arcade. We plan on having the 5th game in by end of Q2 and hope to have the funds to build a 6th and 7th game by the end of the fiscal year.

## Benefits for the community
More games means more fun, more potential outcomes, and increasing value for the overall ecosystem. We make sure to collaborate with other projects on Algorand at least once a month,
driving engagement and sales for these projects. We ask for near nothing in return as we believe in the long-term here.
